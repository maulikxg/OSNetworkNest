# Basics of Operating System

## What is an Operating System (OS)?
An **Operating System (OS)** is system software that manages both hardware and software resources effectively.

### Hardware Resources Managed by OS:
- **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Allocates and manages memory for running processes.
- **Memory Management:** Handles memory allocation and swapping.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit):** Schedules tasks for efficient processing.

### Software Resources Managed by OS:
- **Processes:** Manages process lifecycle (creation, execution, termination).
- **Threads:** Provides multi-threading capabilities.
- **System Libraries:** Facilitates communication between hardware and software.
- **Networking Protocols:** Ensures proper data communication between devices.
- **User Management:** Handles user authentication and access control.

## Purpose of an OS:
An operating system provides a **platform** for applications to run efficiently and interact with the hardware.

> Without an OS, the hardware and software of a computer would not function cohesively.
