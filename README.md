# Basics of Operating System - Linux Commands

## Overview
The operating system is system software that manages hardware resources like RAM, memory, CPU, and software resources like processes, threads, system libraries, networking protocols, and user management. It provides a platform on top of which other programs (applications) can run.

## Types of Operating Systems

### 1. **Batch Operating System**
   - Operator takes similar jobs having the same requirements and groups them into batches.

### 2. **Multiprogramming**
   - More than one program is present in the main memory, and any one of them can be kept in execution.

### 3. **Time Sharing**
   - A type of multiprogramming system where every process runs in a round-robin manner. Each task is given some time to execute so that all the tasks work smoothly.

### 4. **Multi-tasking**
   - Time-sharing and multiprogramming systems are also called multitasking, as multiple tasks run in an interleaving manner.

### 5. **Multi-processing**
   - More than one CPU is used for the execution of resources.

### 6. **Multi-user**
   - These systems allow multiple users to be active at the same time. These systems can be either multiprocessor or single processor with interleaving.

### 7. **Distributed**
   - Interconnected computers communicate with each other using a shared communication network. Independent systems possess their own memory unit and CPU.

### 8. **Network**
   - These systems run on a server and provide the capability to manage data, users, groups, security, applications, and other networking functions.

### 9. **Real-time**
   - Real-time systems are used when there are very strict time requirements, such as missile systems, air traffic control systems, robots, etc.

## What is Kernel?
- The kernel acts as a bridge between hardware resources and software.
- It manages the communication of system resources with software applications.
