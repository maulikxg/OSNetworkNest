# Linux Memory and System Monitoring Commands


## 1. `free` - Display Memory Usage

The `free` command in Linux provides insights into the system's memory usage, including physical RAM and swap memory. It is useful for performance monitoring and troubleshooting memory issues.

### Basic Usage of `free`

```sh
maulikpuri@maulikpuri-ThinkPad-T14s-Gen-1:~$ free
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:       15991304     4147060     5833312      532304     6010932    10674492
Swap:       2097148           0     2097148

```

#### Explanation:

- **Free**: Memory that is completely unallocated.
- **Shared***: Memory that is used by multiple processes(shared libraries, shared memory segments).
- **buff/cache**: (Buffer) Used as temporary storage of data before writing to disk. (cache) is the page cache.
- **available**: This is more accurate estimate of free RAM, as it accounts for buffer aswell: **free + reclaimable(cache/buffer)**



### Human-Readable Format

```sh
maulikpuri@maulikpuri-ThinkPad-T14s-Gen-1:~$ free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           15Gi       3.2Gi       6.3Gi       395Mi       5.7Gi        11Gi
Swap:         2.0Gi          0B       2.0Gi
```

#### Why Use `-h`?

- Converts memory values into an easier-to-read format (GB, MB, KB).
- Helps quickly understand system memory allocation.

### Show Total Memory Including Swap

```sh
free -t
```

#### Explanation:

- Adds an extra row displaying the total memory (RAM + Swap) combined.

### Continuously Monitor Memory Usage Every 5 Seconds

```sh
free -h -s 5
```

#### Explanation:

- Updates memory usage every 5 seconds for real-time monitoring.

## Real-Life Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen & Tables üçΩÔ∏è

Think of your **RAM** as a restaurant:

- **Total memory** = Total tables in the restaurant.
- **Used memory** = Tables occupied by customers.
- **Free memory** = Completely empty tables (but restaurants rarely leave tables empty!).
- **Buff/cache** = Reserved tables that are cleaned and can be used quickly.
- **Available memory** = Free + Cleaned tables (tables that can be used immediately).
- **Swap** = Extra chairs outside the restaurant (if all tables are full, people wait outside, but it's uncomfortable and slow!).

üí° **Moral:** A restaurant (Linux) keeps tables (RAM) occupied as much as possible, cleaning and reusing them when needed. This is why **free memory is low but available memory is what really matters!** üöÄ

## 2. `vmstat` - Virtual memory statistics

The `vmstat` command (short for "virtual memory statistics") reports information about processes, memory, paging, block IO, traps, and CPU activity. It‚Äôs a very useful command to monitor your system's health and performance, especially when debugging performance issues.

### Basic Syntax:
```bash
vmstat [options] [delay [count]]
```
- **delay**: The number of seconds between each report (optional).
- **count**: The number of reports to display (optional).

## Key Columns in `vmstat` Output:



### 1. **Processes (procs):**
- **r**: The number of processes waiting for CPU time (ready to run).
- **b**: The number of processes in uninterruptible sleep (blocked processes, often waiting for I/O).

### 2. **Memory:**
- **swpd**: The amount of virtual memory used (in KB). When physical memory is exhausted, the system uses swap space on disk.
- **free**: The amount of free memory (in KB).
- **buff**: Memory used as buffers by the kernel (in KB).
- **cache**: Memory used for caching data (in KB). Cached data helps improve I/O performance.

### 3. **Swap:**
- **si**: The amount of memory swapped in from disk (in KB per second). This indicates the system is swapping memory from the disk to RAM.
- **so**: The amount of memory swapped out to disk (in KB per second). This means the system is moving data from RAM to disk to free up memory.

### 4. **I/O (Input/Output):**
- **bi**: Blocks received from a block device (in blocks per second). This shows data being read from disk.
- **bo**: Blocks sent to a block device (in blocks per second). This shows data being written to disk.

### 5. **System:**
- **in**: The number of interrupts per second, including the clock.
- **cs**: The number of context switches per second. A context switch occurs when the CPU switches from one process to another, typically when it‚Äôs done running one process and picks up another.

### 6. **CPU (in percentages):**
- **us**: The percentage of CPU time spent running user processes (non-kernel code).
- **sy**: The percentage of CPU time spent running system (kernel) code.
- **id**: The percentage of CPU time spent idle, doing nothing.
- **wa**: The percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.
- **st**: The percentage of CPU time stolen from a virtual machine (relevant in VM environments).

## Example Usage

1. **Basic Command** (Single snapshot):
   To get a snapshot of your system's resource usage, simply run:
   ```bash
   vmstat
   ```

2. **Monitoring Over Time (with delay)**:
   To get a report every 1 second, run:
   ```bash
   vmstat 1
   ```
   This will keep printing the system‚Äôs stats every second.

3. **Limit the Number of Reports**:
   To get 5 reports, 1 second apart:
   ```bash
   vmstat 1 5
   ```
   This will output 5 reports, each showing stats for a 1-second interval.

## Example Output:
Let‚Äôs take a look at an example output:
```bash
$ vmstat 1 5
procs  memory      swap          io     system     cpu
r  b   swpd  free  buff  cache  si  so  bi  bo  in  cs us sy id wa st
1  0  1024  2048  256   512   0   0   10  20  100 200  10  15 70  5  0
1  0  1024  2040  256   512   0   0   12  25  105 210  12  17 68  4  0
1  0  1024  2035  256   512   0   0   15  18  110 220  14  18 65  3  0
1  0  1024  2020  256   512   0   0   13  30  115 230  16  19 62  4  0
1  0  1024  2015  256   512   0   0   14  28  120 240  18  20 60  5  0
```

## Key Insights from the Output:
- **Processes**: In the "procs" section, `r` shows 1 process is waiting for CPU time and `b` shows no blocked processes.
- **Memory**: 
   - `swpd` (swap usage) is 1024 KB, indicating that some memory is swapped out to disk.
   - `free` memory decreases slightly each time, showing some memory is being used.
   - `buff` and `cache` remain the same, indicating no change in buffers or cached memory.
- **Swap**: No swap activity (`si` and `so` are both 0), so no memory is being swapped in or out.
- **I/O**: `bi` and `bo` show data is being transferred to and from disk, but the numbers are low, so the system is not heavily relying on disk I/O.
- **CPU**: 
   - `us` (user CPU time) is around 10%, meaning most of the CPU time is spent on user processes.
   - `sy` (system CPU time) is around 15%, indicating some kernel activity.
   - `id` (idle time) is around 70%, showing the CPU is not overly busy.
   - `wa` (waiting for I/O) is low, meaning the CPU isn't waiting much for I/O operations.

## Interpreting the Data:
- **CPU load**: If the `us` and `sy` columns are high, your system is busy running user or system processes. If `id` is high, the CPU is mostly idle.
- **Memory usage**: If `free` memory is low, or `swpd` is high, your system may be running out of RAM and starting to swap, which can slow down the performance.
- **I/O activity**: High `bi` (blocks in) and `bo` (blocks out) may indicate heavy disk usage, which can affect performance if the system relies heavily on disk operations.

## Key Considerations:
- If you‚Äôre seeing high swap usage (`si` and `so` values), it could indicate that your system doesn't have enough physical memory.
- High `r` (ready to run) process counts indicate that there are many processes waiting for CPU time, which might indicate CPU saturation.

## 3. `dstat` - System Resource Monitoring in Real Time

The `dstat` command in Linux is a versatile tool that provides detailed and real-time statistics about various system resources, such as CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network traffic, and more. It's an excellent tool for performance monitoring and debugging system bottlenecks.







## 3. `dstat` - Versatile Resource Statistics

The `dstat` command is a powerful tool for monitoring various system resources in real-time. It provides an in-depth overview of various metrics such as CPU, memory, disk, network, and I/O usage. `dstat` is a more flexible alternative to commands like `vmstat` and `iostat`.

### Basic Syntax:
```bash
dstat [options] [delay] [count]
```
- **delay**: The number of seconds between each update (optional).
- **count**: The number of reports to display (optional).

### Key Metrics in `dstat` Output:

1. **CPU:**
   - **usr**: User CPU time.
   - **sys**: System CPU time.
   - **idl**: Idle CPU time.
   - **wai**: CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations.

2. **Memory:**
   - **used**: Memory used.
   - **buff**: Memory used as buffers.
   - **cach**: Memory used as cache.
   - **free**: Free memory.

3. **Disk:**
   - **read**: Data read from the disk (KB/s).
   - **writ**: Data written to the disk (KB/s).

4. **Network:**
   - **recv**: Data received (KB/s).
   - **send**: Data sent (KB/s).

5. **Swap:**
   - **si**: Memory swapped in (KB/s).
   - **so**: Memory swapped out (KB/s).

### Example Usage:

1. **Basic Command**:
   ```bash
   dstat
   ```

2. **Monitoring Over Time (with delay)**:
   To display updates every 1 second, use:
   ```bash
   dstat 1
   ```

3. **Limit the Number of Reports**:
   To get 5 reports, 1 second apart:
   ```bash
   dstat 1 5
   ```

## Example Output:
```bash
$ dstat 1 5
---- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
usr sys idl wai used buff cach free read writ recv send
---- ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------ ------
10   5    80   5    3.1M  1.5M  2.5M  1.2M  0.3M  1.4M  0.6M
12   6    77   5    3.2M  1.6M  2.5M  1.4M  0.4M  1.5M  0.7M
11   5    79   5    3.1M  1.5M  2.5M  1.3M  0.3M  1.4M  0.7M
13   7    76   4    3.3M  1.6M  2.5M  1.5M  0.4M  1.6M  0.8M
12   6    77   5    3.2M  1.5M  2.6M  1.4M  0.3M  1.5M  0.7M
```

## Key Insights from the Output:
- **CPU**: 
   - `usr` (user CPU time) is around 10%, indicating user-level processes are consuming CPU time.
   - `sys` (system CPU time) is 5%, showing kernel-level processes.
   - `idl` (idle CPU time) is around 77%, indicating the CPU is not heavily loaded.
- **Memory**: 
   - Memory usage is steady with slight fluctuation, showing the system has a good balance of used and cached memory.
- **Disk**: 
   - Data is being read and written at a steady pace, with some data transfer activity, but not heavy.
- **Network**: 
   - Network activity is visible with data received and sent, showing minimal network traffic.
- **Swap**: 
   - No significant swap activity (si, so are low), so the system isn't experiencing memory pressure.




## 4. `top` & `htop`
