### **Exploring `netstat` in Detail**

`netstat` (short for **network statistics**) is a command-line tool used for **monitoring network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships**. It is available in Unix-based systems like **Linux (including Ubuntu)** and also Windows.


---

## **1. Basic Usage of `netstat`**
To run `netstat`, simply open a terminal and type:

```bash
netstat
```

This will display all active connections, but the output might be large and hard to read. Let's break it down with options.

---

## **2. Understanding `netstat` Output**
A basic `netstat` command shows:

```
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State      
tcp        0      0 192.168.1.100:22        192.168.1.10:54321      ESTABLISHED
```

| Column Name      | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Proto**       | Protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.) |
| **Recv-Q**      | Received queue (packets waiting to be processed) |
| **Send-Q**      | Send queue (packets waiting to be sent) |
| **Local Address** | IP and port of the local machine |
| **Foreign Address** | IP and port of the remote machine |
| **State**       | Connection status (e.g., ESTABLISHED, LISTEN, CLOSE_WAIT) |

---

## **3. Useful `netstat` Options**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Show all listening and non-listening sockets**
```bash
netstat -a
```
This shows all **active and passive** connections.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Display only listening ports**
```bash
netstat -l
```
This shows only **listening** sockets (services waiting for connections).

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Show TCP connections**
```bash
netstat -t
```
This filters the results to show only **TCP** connections.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Show UDP connections**
```bash
netstat -u
```
This filters the results to show only **UDP** connections.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Display process ID (PID) associated with each connection**
```bash
netstat -p
```
This helps identify which **program/process** is using a connection.

Example:
```bash
netstat -tulpn
```
- `t` ‚Üí TCP  
- `u` ‚Üí UDP  
- `l` ‚Üí Listening  
- `p` ‚Üí Process ID  
- `n` ‚Üí Numeric output (prevents DNS resolution)

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Display routing table**
```bash
netstat -r
```
This shows the **kernel routing table**, similar to the `route` command.

Example Output:
```
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
0.0.0.0        192.168.1.1     0.0.0.0         UG      0 0          0 eth0
192.168.1.0    0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   U       0 0          0 eth0
```

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Show network interface statistics**
```bash
netstat -i
```
This gives detailed **network interface** statistics.

Example Output:
```
Iface   MTU  RX-OK  TX-OK   RX-ERR  TX-ERR  RX-DRP  TX-DRP
eth0    1500  12345  6789   0       0       0       0
lo      65536 23456  5678   0       0       0       0
```

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Display network connections continuously**
```bash
netstat -c
```
This refreshes every second, similar to `top`.

---

## **4. Advanced Filtering with `grep`**
Since `netstat` output can be long, use **`grep`** to filter results.

### **Find all active SSH connections**
```bash
netstat -tulpn | grep ssh
```

### **Find all ESTABLISHED connections**
```bash
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED
```

### **Find all LISTENING services**
```bash
netstat -an | grep LISTEN
```

---

## **5. Alternative Modern Tools**
Since `netstat` is **deprecated** in newer Linux distributions, you might want to use:

1. **`ss` (socket statistics)** ‚Äì Faster replacement for `netstat`
   ```bash
   ss -tulnp
   ```

2. **`ip` command** ‚Äì Modern replacement for `ifconfig` and `route`
   ```bash
   ip route
   ```

3. **`lsof -i`** ‚Äì Lists open network sockets
   ```bash
   lsof -i -P -n
   ```

4. **`nmap`** ‚Äì Powerful network scanner
   ```bash
   nmap -p 1-65535 localhost
   ```

---

## **Conclusion**
- `netstat` is a powerful command for monitoring **network connections, routing tables, and interfaces**.
- It can help troubleshoot **network issues, identify open ports, and detect active connections**.
- While `netstat` is still useful, tools like **`ss`**, **`ip`**, and **`lsof`** are recommended in modern systems.

### **How Many Stats Are Possible in `netstat`?**  
The `netstat` command provides a **variety of network statistics** across different aspects of system networking. These statistics can be categorized into different sections:

---

## **1. Connection Statistics**
These stats show **current network connections** and their states.

### **üîπ TCP Connections**
```bash
netstat -t
```
Possible **TCP connection states**:
| State         | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| **LISTEN**   | Waiting for incoming connections |
| **ESTABLISHED** | Active connection between client and server |
| **CLOSE_WAIT** | Waiting for socket closure after receiving FIN |
| **TIME_WAIT** | Waiting before closing connection |
| **SYN_SENT** | Connection request sent, waiting for reply |
| **SYN_RECV** | Received connection request, waiting for confirmation |
| **FIN_WAIT1** | Closing initiated, waiting for acknowledgment |
| **FIN_WAIT2** | Waiting for final closure from the other side |
| **CLOSED** | Connection fully closed |
| **LAST_ACK** | Waiting for last acknowledgment before closing |

### **üîπ UDP Connections**
```bash
netstat -u
```
- No states in UDP since it is **connectionless**.

---

## **2. Listening Services**
This shows **ports that are listening** for connections.

```bash
netstat -l
```
- Includes both **TCP and UDP** listening ports.

### **Filter by Protocol**
- **TCP only**: `netstat -lt`
- **UDP only**: `netstat -lu`
- **Raw sockets**: `netstat -lr`
- **UNIX domain sockets**: `netstat -lx`

---

## **3. Routing Table Statistics**
Shows the **kernel's routing table** (similar to `route -n`).
```bash
netstat -r
```
Possible routing stats:
| Field  | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Destination** | Network destination (0.0.0.0 = default gateway) |
| **Gateway** | Next-hop gateway |
| **Genmask** | Subnet mask |
| **Flags** | Route flags (U = Up, G = Gateway, H = Host, etc.) |
| **Iface** | Interface used (eth0, wlan0, etc.) |

---

## **4. Network Interface Statistics**
Shows **interface-level statistics**.
```bash
netstat -i
```
Possible stats:
| Field  | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **RX-OK / TX-OK** | Packets successfully received/sent |
| **RX-ERR / TX-ERR** | Packets with errors |
| **RX-DRP / TX-DRP** | Dropped packets |
| **RX-OVR / TX-OVR** | Buffer overruns |
| **Flg** | Interface flags (BMRU, LRU, etc.) |

---

## **5. Multicast Group Memberships**
Shows **multicast groups joined** by the system.
```bash
netstat -g
```
- Useful for debugging multicast traffic.

---

## **6. Network Packet Statistics**
Provides global network packet statistics.
```bash
netstat -s
```
Possible stats:
- **IP statistics** (packets received, fragments, dropped, etc.)
- **TCP statistics** (connections established, resets, retransmissions)
- **UDP statistics** (datagrams sent, dropped, errors)
- **ICMP statistics** (echo requests, responses, errors)

---

## **7. Process & Socket Associations**
Shows which **process (PID) owns which socket**.
```bash
netstat -p
```
Useful for:
- Identifying which process is using a port.
- Debugging port conflicts.

---

### **Summary: How Many Stats Are There?**
`netstat` provides statistics in **7 main categories**:
1. **Active connections (`-t`, `-u`, `-a`)**
2. **Listening ports (`-l`, `-lt`, `-lu`, `-lx`)**
3. **Routing table (`-r`)**
4. **Network interfaces (`-i`)**
5. **Multicast memberships (`-g`)**
6. **Packet statistics (`-s`)**
7. **Process/socket relationships (`-p`)**

Each category has **multiple possible states and counters**.

### **Understanding `netstat -i` Output**  
The `netstat -i` command is used to **display statistics of network interfaces** on your system. It provides details about how much data is being sent and received, along with error statistics.

---

### **Example Output**
```bash
netstat -i
```
```
Kernel Interface table
Iface   MTU  RX-OK  RX-ERR  RX-DRP  RX-OVR  TX-OK  TX-ERR  TX-DRP  TX-OVR  Flg
eth0   1500  234567  0       5       0       123456  0       0       0       BMRU
lo     65536  45678  0       0       0       45678   0       0       0       LRU
wlan0  1500  87654   1       2       0       65432   0       1       0       BMRU
```

---

### **Breakdown of Each Column**
| Column  | Description |
|---------|------------|
| **Iface** | Network interface name (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`, `lo`) |
| **MTU**   | Maximum Transmission Unit (size of the largest packet that can be sent) |
| **RX-OK** | Number of packets **received successfully** |
| **RX-ERR** | Number of **receive errors** (corrupted or dropped packets) |
| **RX-DRP** | Number of **dropped received packets** due to buffer overflow or congestion |
| **RX-OVR** | Number of **receive overruns** (packets lost because the kernel couldn't process them fast enough) |
| **TX-OK** | Number of packets **transmitted successfully** |
| **TX-ERR** | Number of **transmission errors** |
| **TX-DRP** | Number of **dropped transmitted packets** |
| **TX-OVR** | Number of **transmit overruns** (packets lost due to high transmission load) |
| **Flg** | Interface flags (e.g., `BMRU`, `LRU`, etc.) |

---

### **Understanding Interface Flags**
The `Flg` (flags) column contains letters that indicate **interface status**:

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **B** | Broadcast (supports sending broadcast messages) |
| **M** | Multicast (supports multicast communication) |
| **R** | Running (interface is up and running) |
| **U** | Up (interface is active) |
| **L** | Loopback (local loopback interface) |

---

### **Example Analysis**
#### **Example 1: Ethernet Interface (`eth0`)**
```
eth0   1500  234567  0  5  0  123456  0  0  0  BMRU
```
- This means:
  - **234567 packets received successfully**
  - **5 packets dropped on receive**
  - **123456 packets sent successfully**
  - No errors or overruns

#### **Example 2: Wi-Fi Interface (`wlan0`)**
```
wlan0  1500  87654  1  2  0  65432  0  1  0  BMRU
```
- This means:
  - **87654 packets received successfully**
  - **1 receive error (corrupted packet)**
  - **2 received packets dropped**
  - **65432 packets sent successfully**
  - **1 transmitted packet dropped**

#### **Example 3: Loopback Interface (`lo`)**
```
lo  65536  45678  0  0  0  45678  0  0  0  LRU
```
- This is the **loopback interface**, used for local communication.
- **Packets sent and received are the same** (expected behavior).
- **No errors or drops** (loopback is very stable).

---

### **Troubleshooting Using `netstat -i`**
- **High `RX-ERR` or `TX-ERR`?**  
  ‚Üí Possible hardware issues or interference (check cables or Wi-Fi signal).
  
- **High `RX-DRP` or `TX-DRP`?**  
  ‚Üí Indicates congestion or buffer overflow (network too busy).

- **High `RX-OVR` or `TX-OVR`?**  
  ‚Üí Kernel is overloaded and dropping packets (consider increasing system resources).

- **Interface missing from the list?**  
  ‚Üí The interface may be **down**. Check with:
  ```bash
  ip link show
  ```

---

### **Alternative Command for Interface Stats**
For a real-time view of interface statistics, use:
```bash
watch -d -n 1 netstat -i
```
This updates the output every second.

Alternatively, use `ip -s link` for modern output:
```bash
ip -s link
```

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- `netstat -i` is useful for **monitoring network interface performance**.
- Helps in **debugging network drops, errors, and overruns**.
- Alternative tools like `ip -s link` and `ifconfig` can provide similar details.
